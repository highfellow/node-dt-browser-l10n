node-dt-dom-l10n
================

A localisation plugin for node-dynamictemplate's browser adapters. This should work with either dt-jquery or dt-dom, but has only been tested with dt-jquery.

See the example directory for an example of the API.

There is a demo here: <http://highfellow.github.com/node-dt-browser-l10n/example/example.html>. The default language is set from navigator.language; the meaning of this differs between browsers, but in firefox it reflects the preferred language setting from your firefox preferences.
